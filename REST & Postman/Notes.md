An API is a programming interface thru which client sends a request to the server to communicate/fetch the data.
Postman connects with these APIs through internet & makes working with APIs easier.

"Resource" is something client wants to know / may be the data client is looking for. URL is used.

- We start with `npm init`. Then install using `npm i packageName`
- `express` is a web framework that can be used along with Nodejs. It allows in creating RESTful APIs using helper methods.    
- `joi` is a library for validating whether the information is in correct format or not.
- `nodemon` is helpful in not needing to restart the node server everytime we make a change. It will detect the changes & restart the server for us. It basically monitors!

- Postman is basically a tool which is used to send requests to the servers.
