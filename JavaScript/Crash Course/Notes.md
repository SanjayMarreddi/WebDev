Javascript is a high level just-in-time compiled programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.

JS along with HTML, CSS is one of the core technologies of the www. We can build server side applications.
It is  also used in mobile app development to create cross platform apps that can run on both IOS & android. It is also used to create desktop applications. 
Now, lets learn the syntax & core concepts.

- We can run the Javascript code in 4 ways:  
  - Opening console by clicking inspect element in browser & typing the code, 
  - Using the script tag in HTML and writing code there itself ( Output comes to console when HTML file is executed. )
  - Using the script tag with src mentioned as a separate js file which contains code. ( Output similar to above line. )
  - Open a terminal & call `node fileName`

- The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include: Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. Sync is single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time. Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server. Also, for concept of async & await keywords, use:
