- Java is an OOP Language
- Java is not just a language, its a technology too.
- Source code --> ( Compiler ) ---> Byte code    ---> ( Java Virtual Machine )   --> Object which can be executed.
- Naming Conventions: 
  - For Interface, Class first letter is capital.
    - Use Camel Casing when more than 1 word is present in names. Ex:  MyFirstJavaClass, stockPrice, actionPerformed
    - It is applicable for all except the packages ( Where all are small ) & in constants ( Where all are capital )
